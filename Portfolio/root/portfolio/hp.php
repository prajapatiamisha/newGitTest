Attractive design and photography can make the products more appealing to visitors and increase sales.

There are a lot of different design styles and approaches that are used by online fashion shops, but generally photography and product/model images play a large role.

Sometimes the design and layout is minimal, allowing for more empasis on the products. Others feature huge photos as the primary focal point of the page.
